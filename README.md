## Tools:<br />
Mypy: https://github.com/python/mypy <br />
Mypy is a static type checker for Python. It analyzes your Python code and determines the type of each variable, function parameter, and return value, and then checks that they are being used correctly throughout the code. This helps catch errors early in the development process, and also makes code easier to understand and maintain.

Pylint: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint <br />
Pylint is a tool for checking your Python code for errors, code style violations, and other issues. It checks for issues such as unused variables, undefined variables, invalid function names, and more. It also provides suggestions for improving the code, such as suggesting more descriptive variable names or recommending the use of list comprehensions.

Pyflakes: https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes  <br />
Pyflakes is another Python code checker that focuses on finding common errors and issues in your code. It checks for issues such as undefined variables, unused imports, and other common mistakes. Pyflakes is lightweight and fast, making it a good choice for quick code analysis.

Pycodestyle (pep8): https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle <br />
Pycodestyle (formerly known as pep8) is a tool for checking your Python code against the PEP 8 style guide. PEP 8 is a set of guidelines for writing Python code that is easy to read and maintain. Pycodestyle checks your code for violations of these guidelines, such as using tabs instead of spaces, having lines that are too long, and more.

Flake8: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8 <br />
Flake8 is a combination of Pyflakes, Pycodestyle, and McCabe complexity checker. It checks for errors, code style violations, and complexity issues all in one tool. It's a popular choice for Python code checking because it combines multiple tools into one easy-to-use package.

Prospector: https://github.com/PyCQA/prospector <br />
Prospector is a tool that combines several other Python code analysis tools, including Pylint, Pyflakes, and pep8. It also includes additional checks for issues such as security vulnerabilities and code smells. Prospector provides a comprehensive analysis of your Python code and can help you identify areas for improvement.

Bandit: https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit <br />
Bandit is a security-focused tool for checking your Python code for potential security vulnerabilities. It analyzes your code for issues such as hardcoded passwords, SQL injection vulnerabilities, and more. Bandit is an important tool for ensuring that your Python code is secure and free from common security risks.
